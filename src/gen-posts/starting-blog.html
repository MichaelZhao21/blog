<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello! If you've stumbled upon this page, then you're probably in one of two camps: either you're curious as to why I’ve started a blog or the magical internet search gods have randomly suggested my article. And honestly, I just got a lot I want to say! Writing down my thoughts has always been a great way to organize everything bouncing around my head, but I've been exceptionally lousy at keeping up with any form of journaling. If you pick any topic I’m interested in, I could talk about it for hours without stopping. So why not immortalize it in a blog :)</p>
<h1 id="buildingtheblog">Building the Blog</h1>
<p>With my foundation in computer science and dozens of personal projects, the technical creation of the website is probably the <em>easiest</em> part of this process (at least for me).</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>, a super lightweight framework -- essentially a simple abstraction on top of raw HTML and CSS. I opted for SvelteKit over a more common <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> framework, such as <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, because this blog simply doesn't need that level of complexity. Sure, I'll use Next.js for a complex full-stack application, but this site is basically just a markdown viewer. </p>
<p>The only technical feat here is the preprocessing step. I added a custom script to convert my markdown files into HTML using <a href="https://showdownjs.com/">Showdown</a>. I can then import the HTML (using the Svelte <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/special-tags#html">@html</a> directive) based on the page path. The rest of the app is a straightforward SvelteKit app. Everything is deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> and connected to the domain name that I get from <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/">Cloudflare</a>. </p>
<p>I don't want to get too technical here, so I'm gonna move on (but do let me know if you want a detailed devlog someday).</p>
<h1 id="whatimwriting">What I'm Writing</h1>
<p>I'm not an avid writer by any means, so I've struggled a lot with actually getting the motivation to write articles. But I decided now is the time. I'm forcing myself to sit down and <strong>write</strong>.</p>
<p>When I originally had this idea <em>years ago</em>, I thought of making a blog specifically for technical posts. Although I have plenty of technical things to write about, I realized that forcing myself to write about a specific topic with a specific format is no fun. Reminds me of when I tried -- and failed miserably -- to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal">bullet journal</a>. As such, this blog will be <em>literally anything</em> that I think of and want to tell the world. You can think of this blog as me yappin' on the internet. And I already have a ton of ideas! To list a few: book reviews, tech guides, opinion pieces, and cool stuff I'm learning.</p>
<h1 id="keepreading">Keep reading!</h1>
<p>That's pretty much all I have to say for now. If you've made it this far, congrats. I'd love for you to read more of my stuff -- go back to the <a href="/">home page</a> to see all my posts! Regardless of how you got here, thank you so much for taking the time to read this silly little post. Hope you have an amazing day :DD</p>
